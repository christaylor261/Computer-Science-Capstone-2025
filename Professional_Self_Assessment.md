Professional Self‑Assessment
As I reach the conclusion of the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I am proud to reflect on the skills, knowledge, and growth I’ve achieved. This capstone project—through the development and enhancement of a mobile weight-tracking application—has allowed me to demonstrate my ability to deliver complete software solutions while emphasizing professional software design, algorithmic efficiency, and secure database practices.

Strengths and Skill Development
Throughout the program, I’ve grown proficient in full-stack development, mobile application design, and cybersecurity fundamentals. Courses such as Mobile Architecture, Secure Coding, and Client/Server Development helped me integrate both frontend and backend components with a strong focus on modularity, user experience, and secure coding practices.

The enhancements I made in my capstone project show this evolution:
Software Design & Engineering: Implemented MVVM architecture and improved UI layout consistency in the Android application, aligning it with modern design standards.
Algorithms & Data Structures: Improved data filtering and sorting logic to handle weight history efficiently and accurately.
Databases: Optimized Room database queries with indexing and integrated data retrieval using DAO patterns for better performance.

Each enhancement was an opportunity to review my original work, refactor it using best practices, and build a final product that better reflects my capabilities as a software developer.

Collaboration and Communication
While much of my work was completed independently, I continuously collaborated with instructors, peers, and support communities—skills I’ve carried over from my professional role in IT support. Throughout the program, I communicated technical topics through presentations, structured narratives, and GitHub documentation—skills essential in professional software environments where clarity, documentation, and team coordination are critical.

Security and Professional Responsibility
Security has been a consistent focus throughout the program. I now approach all software projects with a security mindset—anticipating threats, validating inputs, and considering secure architecture from the start. Whether securing data in transit or managing local device permissions in Android, I’ve prioritized protecting user information in every phase of development.

Career Direction and Goals
As a full-time firefighter with 12+ years in IT support and system administration, I am now transitioning into a career in cybersecurity engineering or software development. My capstone and ePortfolio showcase this shift by combining secure development principles with real-world applications. I plan to leverage my skills to contribute to roles in application security, secure software architecture, or backend development where security is key.

Summary of Artifacts
The artifacts in this portfolio collectively reflect a journey from building functional applications to delivering professional, secure, and efficient software:

The original mobile app laid the foundation for user-facing functionality.

The enhancements demonstrated my ability to refactor code, integrate advanced features, and solve complex software challenges.

The README and GitHub Pages site present my work with attention to UI/UX principles, version control, and portfolio readiness.

This program has not only expanded my technical knowledge but helped me position myself confidently as a professional ready to deliver real-world solutions. I'm excited for what comes next.
